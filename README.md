To use these functions, save the files to somewhere where Matlab and/or Octave can find them.

In Generalized_private_diagonal.m, we get a lower bound on the private information of generalized Platypus channel.
In Generalized_all_region_vs_coherent_information.m, we get the coherent information of generalized Platypus channel.
In Amplitude_advantange_optimization.m, we get the ratio of informational advantage of two amplitude damping channels.


To get help on any of the functions, try

  $ help <functionname>

at a Matlab or Octave prompt.
